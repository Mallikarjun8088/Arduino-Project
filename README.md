   Arduino-Project
**"Multitasking ROBOT"** 
The project successfully delivered a robot car capable of welcoming guests with both movement and voice interaction.
The robot was designed with both autonomous and manual control features, allowing it to detect and approach guests manually. 
For manual control and for text-to-speech converting, a custom mobile application was developed by our team using MIT App 
Inventor, enabling users to operate the robot conveniently through their smartphones.                                                            

A key achievement of the project was the integration of text-to-speech (TTS) technology. This feature enabled the robot to convert 
any given text into clear, human-like speech. Whether it was greeting visitors by name or providing helpful instructions, the robot
delivered messages in a natural and friendly tone. Overall, the project resulted in a versatile and interactive robotic system that
combined mobility, user-developed app control, and voice communication to enhance guest experiences.
